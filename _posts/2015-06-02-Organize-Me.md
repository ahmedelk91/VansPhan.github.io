I learned so much today but had no real time to really pause and reflect about it.  
So it got me wondering.. This is really important to me, I should really do something about this new-found information. Now that we know these self-improving things or beneficial  knowledge, why does the next day feel the same?  

*So I think I'm on to something*. We take little notes during our daily lives of things  that makes us go "Ah haa". So at the end of the day I feel like it could go either way for  me.  

1. I forget about it.  

2. It motivates and inspires me into productive work mode.  

Even when #2 is on full throttle, eventually motivation wears off and you are then back to  square one. Both number 1 and 2 are not ways to better your life with this new knowledge  you have gained. These self-improvement notes don't actually work unless  
you *plan*. We have to plan a way to start intergrating these new ideas into our lives.  

For example, I learned that it's a good idea to keep track of your expenses and take 30%  of your income to invest in yourself. This was a very huge "ah haa" moment for me, but if  I were to go to bed now it would be the end of it because _I know my morning self has  things to do_. So tonight I am going to make some sort of a to-do list. (You can implement  however you like, I just think lists are awesome) The things on this to-do list are there  to help me intergrate this new idea into my life.  

So please don't ignore these great notes you have taken from articles, ted talks, or  grandpa Joe. _Become what you belive in, so that you can belive in what you have become_.
