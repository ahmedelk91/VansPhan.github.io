This month highlights a huge milestone for me: Graduation. Two years in a community college and the rest of the two years in a university have been a journey that I will never forget. The friends, professors, faculty, and advisors have impacted my life as an undergraduate student. 

Of course, the most important people who've supported my education since kindergarten are my mom and dad. They are the ones who've shown me that no matter how hard it gets, never give up and make my dreams a reality. 

I'm ready to embrace the new opportunities and connections I'll encounter in the years to come.
