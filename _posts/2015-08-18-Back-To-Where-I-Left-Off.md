At the time I was going through some self studying. Studying to become a programmer/developer. Then out of no where, I landed a job as Junior Internal Developer at a tech firm called Whirlwind Technologies. This kinda changed my life. I say kinda because I feel more of the external things changed as in income. With higher income I studied the art of investing and now have a good amount of money in companies I believe in. I try to save as much as I can but I do spend when I want to, for example my recent purchase of $60 worth of in game items on an app game I play. No shame, I live my life the way I want to and you should too! Heh heh. 

-Back to the matter is that with this new job, This hasn't changed my quest to becoming a master programmer. Sure I haven't been studying as much as I would like to due to me settling in my new reality. But now Im back to it.

NORMALLY with a job or like any other responsibilty it's harder to focus on my studies. That's why I quit my last job at Micro Center. I needed time to myself. But no worries with my current job. My technical director encourages everyone to be innovative and continue to learn and become better. I can not ask for a better environment. Im a JUNIOR developer. I don't have that much responsibilty but to learn and get better! My heart is like racing while I type this! Or .. My coffee is just kicking in.. But the point is Im sooo grateful and excited for this. I advise everyone to go and find a job that doesn't suppress your efforts to go towards your true goal in life. Better yet! Find a job that supports that goal. Mine is to have time to study and get better at programming. My responsibilty within the company is just that. 
I recently asked my team lead that I wanted to go to New York and attend a tech bootcamp for 3-4 months to get better. He encourages it and is even going to see if he could have the company help pay for my tuition. I would be working at the same time since I work from home anyways. So I would not skip a beat. So Im in bound for New York sometime in the next couple of months. 
My friends support me, my family supports me, SO MY JOB WILL SUPPORT ME.

I want to be a master programmer so bad.. sooo badd. So here I go.
