This is going to be my personal guide to help me stay on track with  
skills that I am currently learning.  
(Kaufman, Josh. _The First 20 Hours._ New York: Penguin Group, 2014. Print)

	1. The project must be lovable.
	2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time.
	3. Define your target performance level.
	4. Deconstruct the skill in subskills.
	5. Obtain critical tools.
	6. Eliminate barriers and distractions to practice.
	7. Set up dedicated time for practice.
	8. Create fast feedback loops.
	9. Practice by the clock in short bursts.
	10. Emphasize quantity and speed of practice.
