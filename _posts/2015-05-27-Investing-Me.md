To be honest I am so worried about how my post is structured that I wouldn't even start  
a sentence. Well fudge that, I'm done *obsessing* over it. 

####STARTING NOW  

The best advice that I cherish and live by is to invest in oneself. I swear people take   
that to lightly. I see all these students perfecting their resume. This can relate to many  other things too and to a certain degree this is fine, but I draw the line when it is all that they invest in. Obsession can be a good indicator to see that the person is too   caught up with this external perfection that it takes away from their own value.  

Resumes are like trophies to show to people that you are awesome, this just happens to be  the norm within society. This makes sense but why do people decorate their trophies? Does  that make you even more awesome? I don't think so.. So lets say a student spend all of  
thier effort on font, font-size, styling, and down to the border of a resume layout.  
That does not change your degree in lets say Bio-Chemistry. Sure it helps that it's  readable and more pleasing to look at, but if you really want to show how amazing you  
can be, you should use all of that time to go out there and get more trophies.  

There are so many useful skills and knowledge out there that desires your attention.  
Invest yourself with books- the knowledge of many wise people to be downloaded into  
your thoughts. Invest yourself with skills- with mastery you can create infinite amount of possibilities. 

####Because 100 trophies are better than 1 shiny one.
