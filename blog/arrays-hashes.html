        <li><p>What is an array?</p>
        <p>
        An array in an object that consist of many other objects. It has an index for each of its objects starting from 0 and so on.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>What is a hash?</p>
        <p>A hash is like a library with object that has a key associated with it. There is no particular order in a hash so you must use the key to reference the value you need.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>When to use an array</p>
        <p>You use an array when the order of the object is important. The index can become very useful to keep a count of the objects.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>When to use a hash</p>
        <p>Hashes are very useful when you want to make a blueprint for more specific hashes. You could make keys that you want to repeat and then fill out each hash's values differently.
