  <h2>Why use Git?</h2>
  <h4>by Van Phan</h4>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><p>What are the benefits of version control?</p>
        <p>
        The benefits of version control is being able to go back and forth to any checkpoint within the project.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
        <p>When you make a commit, git will have also save side by side comparisons of the changes you made at that time.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>
        <p>Using github to store your code is very beneficial. For example if you are going to continue a project from a different computer all you have to do is clone from your repository and you're good to go.

<!--
- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  The <article> tag is very useful to keep my text organize. I return to it because I don't want to go back to my code and look at all the different type of text tag such as <h1>, <p>, <span>, and so on and having to figure out where an idea start and end. 

- How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  The order of elements are from top to bottom of the html file. Also if it hits an element with nested elements then it must complete it all before moving on.

- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 

  Sublime is amazing! I knew there were shortcuts but not that you could make your own. Now that I know snippets exist I will be sure to make many useful ones that are needed for everyday coding.
