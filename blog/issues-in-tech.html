      <article>   Recently I went to help out a local tech community called Black Girls Code. 
      They are a group that encourages African American girls to get more envolve into computer science. The community of techies are not very diverse esepcially with this specific group. Helping out has taught me that talent can come from anyone regardless of race or gender.
      Having groups like these eliminate fears for those who are to afraid of being a minority when getting involve with the tech community. Programming is such an empowering tool for the future that would be such an upset for someone to not take advantage of it just because of fears like these. 
      I hope for everyone to make the tech community welcoming to anyone and everyone because the tech world can move a lot faster with more minds put together. </article>
